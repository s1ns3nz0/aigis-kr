# RFC 0001 — SIEM / log forwarder layer

> Status: **Draft** · Author: @s1ns3nz0 · Phase 1 reference implementation
> shipped on `feat/siem-forwarder` (this PR).

## Summary

Add a Tier-4 outbound sink — `aigis/forwarders/` — that mirrors every
`ActivityEvent` to external SIEM / log-lake systems (Splunk HEC, Elastic,
Microsoft Sentinel, Datadog, in-house ingest endpoints) without blocking
the agent hot path and without changing the on-disk JSONL tiers.

This lands the Phase 3 roadmap item
[`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md) line 160 ("SIEM integration") as a vertical
slice: foundation + ECS schema mapper + one universal transport (HTTPS
JSON), all in stdlib-only Python so the zero-dep core is preserved.

## Motivation

`ActivityStream` (`aigis/activity.py`) already captures the right events
with the right fields (`user_id`, `risk_score`, `policy_decision`,
`matched_rules`, `owasp_refs`, `autonomy_level`, `delegation_chain`).
`SignedAuditLog` (`aigis/audit/`) gives those events a tamper-evident chain.

But until the events reach the enterprise SOC, several controls stay
checked-in-letter-but-not-in-spirit:

* **ISMS-P 2.9 / 2.11** require log management and 이상행위 분석 *in the
  organisation's central monitoring stack* — local JSONL is not enough.
* **금융위 AI 가이드라인 (2024)** treats LLM-side anomalies as a category
  of 이상행위 탐지; they have to land in the same SOC pipe as everything
  else.
* **Insider-threat / UEBA** correlation needs Aigis signals next to IdP,
  EDR, and DLP signals — that means the SIEM, not a developer's `~/.aigis/`.
* **NIST SP 800-53 AU-2 / AU-6** ("audit events" / "audit review") implies
  centralized review, not per-host log files.

## Goals

1. Add a clean extension point so anyone can plug in a forwarder for their
   SIEM with ~50 LOC of subclass code.
2. Ship a default ECS schema mapper that works for Elastic, Sentinel
   (via DCR), Wazuh, and is straightforward to re-map to Splunk CIM.
3. Preserve every Aigis-native field — `matched_rules`, `owasp_refs`,
   `autonomy_level`, `delegation_chain`, `policy_decision` — verbatim so
   analysts never lose information.
4. Make it physically impossible for a misconfigured or down SIEM to
   slow down, error out, or block an agent tool call.
5. Zero new required dependencies. Transports that need third-party clients
   (e.g. azure-identity for Sentinel managed-identity) go into extras.

## Non-goals (this RFC)

* Pre-built Splunk ES correlation rules or Sentinel analytic rules —
  separate RFC, separate repo cadence.
* Pre-built Sigma detection rule bundle — Phase 4 in the original plan.
* Authentication-flow wrappers per vendor (OAuth refresh, IAM signing) —
  ship as optional subclasses once Phase 1 is merged.

## Design

### Pipeline

```
ActivityStream.record(event)
  ├─ Tier 1: local  JSONL  (unchanged, always)
  ├─ Tier 2: global JSONL  (unchanged, if enabled)
  ├─ Tier 3: alerts JSONL  (unchanged, if is_alert)
  └─ Tier 4: for fwd in self._forwarders: fwd.submit(event)
              └─ enqueue onto bounded background queue → worker thread
                  └─ redact (in-memory dict, before mapping)
                  └─ map   (ActivityEvent → ECS dict, default)
                  └─ batch (size + interval thresholds)
                  └─ ship  (HTTPS POST, with retry policy)
```

The dispatch order matters: the local JSONL tiers are written
*synchronously* and *first*, so they remain authoritative even if the
forwarder layer is misbehaving.

### Class shape

```python
class LogForwarder(ABC):
    def submit(self, event: ActivityEvent) -> None: ...     # never blocks, never raises
    def close(self, timeout: float = 5.0) -> None: ...
    @property
    def stats(self) -> dict[str, int]: ...                  # sent / dropped / queued

    @abstractmethod
    def _ship(self, batch: list[dict]) -> None: ...         # subclass hook

class EventMapper(Protocol):
    def map(self, event: dict) -> dict: ...

class Redactor(Protocol):
    def redact(self, event: dict) -> dict: ...
```

* `Redactor` runs *before* the mapper, on the raw Aigis dict, so PIPA /
  GDPR rules are written against the native field names.
* `EventMapper` is a Protocol (not ABC) so adding CEF / OCSF / Splunk CIM
  is a single file with no inheritance dance.

### Schema — why ECS as default

| Vendor / consumer | ECS support |
|---|---|
| Elastic / Wazuh | Native index pattern, no transform |
| Microsoft Sentinel | Log Ingestion API + DCR consumes ECS JSON directly |
| Splunk | One CIM transform per field (mappable from ECS) |
| OSS SIEMs (SecurityOnion, OpenSearch SIEM) | Native |

ECS is the only schema where the same `event.action` / `user.name` /
`process.command_line` mapping works across the three biggest enterprise
SIEMs. OCSF is gaining momentum (AWS Security Lake) but is not yet
broadly consumed — recommended as a follow-up mapper, not the default.

### Failure isolation

| Failure mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| SIEM unreachable | Worker retries 5xx with exponential backoff; on exhaustion the batch is dropped (still in local JSONL); counter incremented. |
| SIEM returns 4xx | No retry (misconfig). Logged once per batch; counter incremented. |
| Forwarder thread crashes | Caught at `record()` boundary; agent continues; logged. |
| Queue full | Drop oldest pending event, enqueue newest; counter incremented. |
| Mapper raises | Single event dropped; counter incremented; worker continues. |
| Redactor raises | Single event dropped *before mapping*; counter incremented. |

The invariant: **no forwarder failure mode can stop the agent or corrupt
the on-disk JSONL.**

### Compatibility

* New code is fully opt-in. `ActivityStream._forwarders` defaults to `[]`
  and `record()` skips Tier 4 entirely when the list is empty — the hot
  path is unchanged for users who don't register a forwarder.
* No new required dependencies. `pyproject.toml` is not modified by this
  PR; vendor-specific subclasses will introduce extras in follow-up PRs.
* No public API removed or renamed.

## Open questions for maintainers

1. **Default schema.** ECS 8.11.0 is the default in this PR. Any preference
   for OCSF as the default instead, or shipping both side-by-side?
2. **Forwarder registration scope.** Per-`ActivityStream` instance (this
   PR) vs. process-global (one register call covers every stream). Going
   per-instance for testability; happy to add a thin process-global helper
   if you'd prefer that as the public ergonomic.
3. **Queue persistence.** Current queue is in-memory bounded. Should
   Phase 2 add an on-disk spool (SQLite WAL) so a process crash during a
   SIEM outage doesn't drop the queued tail? Cost: ~150 LOC + an integrity
   contract with the JSONL tier.
4. **PII redaction defaults.** Should `details` be redacted by default
   when no `Redactor` is configured? I left it as-is (preserved) to avoid
   silently dropping data analysts may need; happy to flip the default if
   PIPA-first behavior is preferred.

## Acceptance criteria

* `uv run pytest` is green (currently 1726 pass).
* `uv run ruff check aigis/forwarders/ tests/test_forwarders.py aigis/activity.py`
  is clean.
* New code adds no required dependencies (`pyproject.toml` unchanged).
* `ActivityStream` with no forwarders registered behaves identically to
  master (covered by the existing `tests/test_activity.py` suite, all 19
  pre-existing tests still pass).
