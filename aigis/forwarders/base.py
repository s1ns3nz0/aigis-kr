"""Forwarder base classes and the background dispatch queue.

A :class:`LogForwarder` is a thin pipeline: ``ActivityEvent -> map -> redact ->
serialize -> ship``. The dispatch worker runs on a daemon thread and pulls from
a bounded ``queue.Queue``. If the queue saturates (e.g. SIEM is down or slow)
we drop the oldest pending event rather than block the producer — the
authoritative copy is still on disk via :class:`aigis.activity.ActivityStream`'s
local / global / alerts tiers.

Subclasses implement :meth:`LogForwarder._ship` to actually deliver bytes to
the upstream system (HTTPS POST, UDP syslog, AMQP publish, etc.). Everything
else — batching, retries, error isolation, schema mapping, redaction — is
provided here so that adding a new transport is roughly fifty lines.
